# Domain and User Configuration

Password Reset Server can integrate with multiple domains and import users. During installation, you
will be asked to provide the first domain and a user that will be used to reset passwords. This user must
be on the same domain that it will reset passwords on. For more information about creating and
configuring one of these accounts, please see our
[Installation Guide](../../installation/index.md).

When you add a domain, Password Reset Server will begin reading your domainâ€™s groups, users,
organization units and configuration in the background. Until this processing is complete, all information may not be available.
