# PRODUCT OVERVIEW

Password Reset Server is a web-based application that allows users in your Microsoft Active Directory
Domains to reset their password without the help of an administrator. The administrator chooses which
users and Organizational Units are allowed to reset their passwords. These users then enroll in a list of
questions that the administrator chooses. When a user attempts to reset their password, they are
prompted to answer all of their questions to verify their identity. Once the identity has been confirmed,
Password Reset Server will reset and unlock the userâ€™s account.
