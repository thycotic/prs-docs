# Configuring Telesign™

TeleSign is a service that Password Reset Server uses when making phone calls for Phone and SMSQuestions. For more information on TeleSign and their services, please visit their [website](https://www.telesign.com/).

To configure TeleSign for Password Reset Server, you must sign up for their service through their website. Once you have signed up, you will be given a CustomerId and an AuthenticationId. Enter these IDs into the __Configuration Edit__ screen and click __Save__.

To test the phone functionality, click the __Send Test Phone Call__ and when prompted enter your phone number. To test the SMS functionality, click __Send Test SMS__.

>**Note**: Testing the functionality will result in TeleSign charging your account.
