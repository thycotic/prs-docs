# API Guide

Password Reset Server provides web services to allow for 3rd party developers to
interact with Password Reset Server in a developer-friendly way while
maintaining security.

The web services use a standard messaging format called Simple Object Access
Protocol (SOAP for short). SOAP is an XML based message exchange protocol to
exchange information over a standard HTTP connection.

Password Reset Server is built using version 1.2 of the SOAP protocol.

For technical details of the SOAP protocol, please refer to the W3C [here](http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/REC-soap12-part0-20070427/).
