# Introduction

## ASP.NET Website

Group Management Server is installed as an ASP.Net website. The setup.exe installer will setup the website with the correct permissions and configure the appropriate settings in IIS. Once the website is set up, the installation will be completed by a 5-step process within the application itself.

## SQL Server Database

Group Management Server requires an instance of SQL Server for the database backend. The SQL Server database will require a SQL account with *db_owner* permission to complete the installation.

## Administrative Access

Throughout most of this installation, you will be required to be an administrator to perform most of these actions. Please ensure that you are logged on to your system with a Windows account that has administrative permissions.
