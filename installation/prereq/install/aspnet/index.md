# Installing ASP.NET 4.5 and the .NET Framework 4.5.1 / 4.5.2

For operating systems other than Windows 8.1 or Windows Server 2012 R2, .NET Framework 4.5.1 is not included by default. To install version 4.5.1, use the offline installer provided by Microsoft, found [here](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40779).

If you installed IIS in the instructions above, then ASP.NET 4.5 should already be installed.

Microsoft has released an SP2 update for the .NET Framework which contains compatibility fixes for applications running on previous versions. It is recommended that this update is installed after the .NET Framework 4.5 has been installed. It can be downloaded [here](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42642).
