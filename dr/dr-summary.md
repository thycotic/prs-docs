# Summary

The integration of Password Reset Server into our customers’ Business Continuity Planning should not present any unique challenges beyond normal server and database recovery. If your organization already has DR plans for servers and databases, Password Reset Server and its Microsoft SQL database should fit within your organization’s current framework. Using server virtualization to assist with Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery in terms of snapshots, replication, and other 3rd party features are recommended where applicable.
