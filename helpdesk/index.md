# Help Desk Guide

Any user who is assigned to a help desk on a security policy will have access to the help desk interface of Password Reset Server. A user can be placed in the help desk of multiple security policies, and they will be able to reset the password of any user in all policies that they are assigned to.

**Note:** The local administrator account will not be assignable to any help
desk and will not have access to the help desk functionality.
